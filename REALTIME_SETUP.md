# 🚀 QUICK START - Real-Time Messaging

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST run npm dev for real-time to work!

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
Double-click: `start-dev.bat`

This will open 2 terminal windows:
- **Window 1**: Vite Dev Server (for real-time)
- **Window 2**: Laravel Server

### Option 2: Manual Start

Open **TWO** terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 - Vite (REQUIRED for real-time):**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Keep this running! ✅

**Terminal 2 - Laravel:**
```bash
php artisan serve
```

## ✅ How to Know It's Working

### 1. Check Browser Console (F12)
You should see:
```
[Echo] ✓ Connected to Pusher
[Chat] 🔌 Setting up user channel
[Chat] ✓ User channel setup complete
```

### 2. Test Real-Time
1. Open browser in 2 different users (or incognito)
2. Send message from User A
3. User B should see it **instantly** without refresh

---

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### "Echo not initialized" in console?
**Problem:** npm run dev is not running

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if Vite is running
# You should see: "VITE v7.x.x ready in xxx ms"

# If not running, start it:
npm run dev
```

### Messages not appearing?
1. **Check browser console (F12)** - any red errors?
2. **Is Vite running?** - Check terminal
3. **Refresh the page** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
4. **Test Pusher:**
   ```bash
   php artisan pusher:test
   ```

### Still not working?
```bash
# Nuclear option - restart everything
Ctrl+C (stop Vite)
Ctrl+C (stop Laravel)

# Clear cache
php artisan optimize:clear

# Start again
npm run dev      # Terminal 1
php artisan serve # Terminal 2
```

## 📊 What's Happening Under the Hood

1. **Vite compiles** `bootstrap.js` which initializes Echo
2. **Echo connects** to Pusher WebSocket
3. **User channel** subscribes to: `App.Models.User.{your-id}`
4. **Conversation channel** subscribes when you open chat
5. **Messages broadcast** via Pusher
6. **Echo receives** event and calls Livewire
7. **UI updates** instantly!

## 🎯 Quick Commands

```bash
# Test Pusher connection
php artisan pusher:test

# Check if npm packages are installed
npm list laravel-echo pusher-js

# Rebuild assets
npm run build

# Clear everything
php artisan optimize:clear
```
